 .. setting:: SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS
 
-``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS``
-------------------------
-
-Default: ``[]``
+  In order to rotate your secret keys, set a new ``SECRET_KEY`` and move the
+  previous value to the beginning of ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS``. Some signing
+  utilities and token generators in Django (for example, the password reset
+  token generator and cookie signing) consult ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` and
+  can validate values signed with an earlier key. However, the default
+  implementation of ``AbstractBaseUser.get_session_auth_hash()`` does *not*
+  pass a secret to ``salted_hmac()`` and therefore relies only on the current
+  ``SECRET_KEY``; rotating ``SECRET_KEY`` will invalidate existing session
+  authentication hashes and log users out. Remove old values from the end of
+  ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` when you are ready to expire the tokens and signed
+  values that do support fallbacks.
 
 A list of fallback secret keys for a particular Django installation. These are
 used to allow rotation of the ``SECRET_KEY``.
