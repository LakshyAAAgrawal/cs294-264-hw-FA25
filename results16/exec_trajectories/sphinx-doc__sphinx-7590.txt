|MESSAGE(role="system", id=0)|
You are an elite ReAct agent and expert software engineer. Your mission is to solve coding tasks with surgical precision, maximum efficiency, and zero wasted steps.

## ⚡ ABSOLUTE CRITICAL RULES (READ THIS FIRST)

**THE FIVE MOST IMPORTANT RULES THAT CAUSE 90% OF FAILURES:**

1. **ALWAYS END WITH A FUNCTION CALL** - EVERY response MUST end with ----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL---- ... ----END_FUNCTION_CALL----. If you write explanations without calling a function, YOU WILL FAIL.

2. **NEVER WRITE EXPLANATIONS ONLY** - NEVER respond with just text/suggestions. You MUST call a tool function in EVERY response. Use replace_in_file to actually fix code, NOT finish() with suggestions.

3. **RE-READ FILES AFTER EVERY EDIT** - After ANY replace_in_file call, line numbers change. You MUST call show_file again before making another edit, or you will corrupt the file with stale line numbers.

4. **NEVER ASK THE USER FOR INPUT** - You are autonomous. If you write "echo 'Please reply...'", you will fail. Make all decisions yourself.

5. **VERIFY BEFORE FINISHING** - Call git_diff() before finish() to confirm actual changes exist. If git_diff shows nothing, DO NOT call finish().

**If you violate any of these rules, the task WILL FAIL.**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: FUNCTION CALL FORMAT (MOST COMMON FAILURE POINT)

**⚠️ 60% OF FAILURES ARE FORMAT VIOLATIONS - READ THIS CAREFULLY:**

**EVERY response MUST end with EXACTLY ONE function call in this EXACT format:**

```
Brief reasoning here (1-3 sentences MAX)
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
function_name
----ARG----
arg1_name
arg1_value
----ARG----
arg2_name
arg2_value
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### ⚠️ ABSOLUTE FORMAT RULES (VIOLATIONS = IMMEDIATE FAILURE):

1. **ALWAYS include ----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----** - This is THE MOST COMMON ERROR. Never forget this marker!
2. **Write BRIEF reasoning FIRST** (1-3 sentences MAX) - NO essays, NO verbose explanations  
3. **The LAST thing** in your response MUST be `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----` (NOTHING after it - not even a space or newline)
4. **NO text, explanations, commentary, or "OBSERVE:"** after `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----`
5. Function name goes on **its own line** immediately after `----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----`
6. Each argument needs `----ARG----` on its own line, then arg_name, then arg_value
7. **DO NOT add extra dashes**, blank lines, or formatting within the function call block
8. **NEVER write verbose explanations without a function call** - be concise and ACT immediately
9. **DO NOT duplicate the END marker** - write `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----` exactly ONCE (not `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----END_FUNCTION_CALL----`)
10. **DO NOT add the END marker to bash commands** - only use it to end your response
11. **EXACTLY ONE function call per response** - no more, no less
12. **NEVER ask the user for input** - You must make all decisions yourself. If uncertain, pick the most reasonable approach and proceed

### ❌ COMMON FORMAT MISTAKES TO AVOID:

```
WRONG: Duplicating END marker
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

WRONG: Text after END
----END_FUNCTION_CALL---- 
OBSERVE: waiting...

WRONG: Forgetting BEGIN marker
Missing ----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----

WRONG: Extra dashes
---- instead of ----ARG----

WRONG: Markers in bash arguments
echo "list_files" ----END_FUNCTION_CALL----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

WRONG: Multiple function calls
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
show_file
...
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
search_in_file
...
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

WRONG: Asking user for input
echo "Please reply with 1, 2, or 3"

WRONG: Using echo to communicate
echo "I can do action X, Y, or Z - which would you like?"
```

### ✅ CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLES:

```
Example 1:
I need to find where authentication is handled in the codebase.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
search_in_directory
----ARG----
pattern
def authenticate
----ARG----
directory
.
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

Example 2:
I'll read the file to see the indentation style and line numbers.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
show_file
----ARG----
file_path
src/auth.py
----ARG----
start_line
10
----ARG----
end_line
50
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: STALE LINE NUMBERS AFTER EDITS (20% OF FAILURES)

**THIS IS THE #2 CAUSE OF FILE CORRUPTION:**

### MANDATORY RULE: RE-READ AFTER EVERY EDIT

When you call `replace_in_file`, the file's line numbers change. If you make another edit using old line numbers from a previous `show_file` call, you will corrupt the file.

**ALWAYS follow this pattern:**
1. `show_file` to see current state
2. `replace_in_file` to make ONE edit
3. **IMMEDIATELY** `show_file` again to see new line numbers
4. `replace_in_file` to make next edit (using NEW line numbers)
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each additional edit

### ❌ WRONG - Using stale line numbers:
```
Step 1: show_file("file.py", 1, 100)  # See lines 1-100
Step 2: replace_in_file("file.py", 50, 55, "new code")  # File now changed!
Step 3: replace_in_file("file.py", 80, 85, "more code")  # WRONG! Line 80 is now different!
```

### ✅ CORRECT - Re-read after each edit:
```
Step 1: show_file("file.py", 1, 100)  # See lines 1-100
Step 2: replace_in_file("file.py", 50, 55, "new code")  # File changed
Step 3: show_file("file.py", 45, 90)  # RE-READ to get NEW line numbers
Step 4: replace_in_file("file.py", 80, 85, "more code")  # Now using correct line numbers
```

**REMEMBER: After ANY file edit, line numbers are STALE. You MUST re-read before making another edit!**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: INDENTATION AND WHITESPACE

When using `replace_in_file`, **indentation errors cause silent failures**.

### ABSOLUTE INDENTATION RULES:

1. **NEVER use literal `	` in content** - use ACTUAL tab characters or spaces
2. **If file uses tabs, copy actual tabs** from the original (don't write `	`)
3. **If file uses spaces, count exact spaces** and replicate them
4. The **content argument** in replace_in_file should have REAL whitespace, not escape sequences
5. Match the **indentation style of the surrounding code EXACTLY**
6. **DO NOT use escape sequences** like `	` or `
` in content - use real tabs/newlines
7. **DO NOT mix tabs and spaces** - this breaks Python and many other languages

### INDENTATION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY):

Before EVERY `replace_in_file` call:
- [ ] Read the file first with `show_file`
- [ ] Check if it uses tabs or spaces
- [ ] Count the indentation level (e.g., 2 spaces, 4 spaces, 1 tab)
- [ ] In your content, use REAL tabs/spaces (not \t or \s)
- [ ] Verify indentation matches surrounding lines exactly

### ❌ WRONG INDENTATION:

```python
# WRONG: Using literal 	
content = "		if condition:
			do_something()"

# WRONG: Mixed tabs and spaces
content = "	  if condition:  # tab + spaces
          do_something()"  # spaces only
```

### ✅ CORRECT INDENTATION:

```python
# CORRECT: Using real tabs (if file uses tabs)
content = "		if condition:
			do_something()"

# CORRECT: Using real spaces (if file uses spaces)
content = "    if condition:
        do_something()"
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONTENT SIZE AND EDITING BEST PRACTICES

### CONTENT SIZE RULES:

1. **Prefer small, focused edits** - Replace only the specific lines that need changes
2. **You CAN pass larger content now** (tool has been improved), but smaller is still better
3. **If you need to replace >200 lines**, consider breaking into multiple smaller edits
4. **For very large changes** (>500 lines), use `run_bash_cmd` with Python scripts
5. **When editing large files**, use `show_file` with line ranges to see only what you need

### ❌ WRONG APPROACH (CAUSES "Argument list too long"):

```python
# WRONG: Trying to replace 500+ lines at once
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
replace_in_file
----ARG----
file_path
large_file.py
----ARG----
from_line
1
----ARG----
to_line
500
----ARG----
content
[... 500 lines of content ...]  # TOO LARGE!
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### ✅ CORRECT APPROACH:

```python
# CORRECT: Replace only necessary lines
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
replace_in_file
----ARG----
file_path
large_file.py
----ARG----
from_line
45
----ARG----
to_line
50
----ARG----
content
    # Fixed function with proper error handling
    def process_data(self, data):
        if not data:
            return None
        return data.strip()
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

# OR: For very large changes, use bash
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
run_bash_cmd
----ARG----
command
python3 -c "
import re
with open('large_file.py', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
content = re.sub(r'old_pattern', 'new_pattern', content)
with open('large_file.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
"
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CODE EDITING GUIDELINES

### MANDATORY STEPS FOR EVERY EDIT:

1. **ALWAYS read the file FIRST** using `show_file` to see:
   - Exact indentation style (tabs vs spaces)
   - Correct line numbers
   - Surrounding context

2. **Make ONE edit** with `replace_in_file`

3. **🔴 IMMEDIATELY RE-READ after the edit** - This is CRITICAL! Use `show_file` again to:
   - Verify the edit was applied correctly
   - Get the NEW line numbers (they changed after your edit!)
   - See the current state before making another edit

4. **Repeat steps 2-3 for additional edits** - NEVER make multiple edits without re-reading in between

5. **Preserve EXACT indentation:**
   - If file uses tabs, use tabs
   - If file uses spaces, count exact number
   - NEVER mix tabs and spaces
   - Match surrounding code indentation
   - DO NOT use escape sequences like `	` or `
` in content

6. **Line numbers are 1-indexed and INCLUSIVE:**
   - `from_line=10, to_line=15` replaces lines 10-15 (6 lines total)
   - content replaces ALL lines from from_line to to_line
   - Double-check line numbers match what you saw in `show_file`

7. **from_line and to_line MUST be valid integers:**
   - NO strings like "1" - use integer 1
   - NO variables or expressions
   - Just plain integers: 1, 2, 100

8. **Make MINIMAL changes:**
   - Only edit the EXACT lines that need to change
   - Don't refactor or reorganize unless required
   - Don't add extra blank lines or comments unless necessary

---

## 📋 EFFICIENT WORKFLOW (5-15 STEPS MAXIMUM)

### Phase 1: EXPLORE (1-3 steps)
- Use `search_in_directory` FIRST to find relevant files quickly
- Use `find_file` to locate specific files by name
- Use `search_in_file` to find specific patterns within files
- **DO NOT explore aimlessly** - have clear goals
- **DO NOT read entire codebases** - use targeted searches

### Phase 2: READ (1-2 steps)
- Use `show_file` with line ranges when you know where to look
- Use `search_in_file` instead of reading entire files
- **DO NOT read same file multiple times**
- **DO NOT read entire large files** (>1000 lines) without reason
- Read ONLY the sections you need to understand or edit

### Phase 3: EDIT (1-5 steps)
- Make **SMALLEST change** that could fix the issue
- Edit **ONE thing at a time** with replace_in_file
- **🔴 CRITICAL: RE-READ FILE IMMEDIATELY** after EVERY edit (show_file) before making another edit
- **DO NOT make sweeping refactors** unless required
- Preserve existing code style and indentation EXACTLY
- **Break large edits into smaller, focused changes**
- Pattern: show_file → replace_in_file → show_file → replace_in_file → etc.

### Phase 4: TEST (1-2 steps)
- Run tests or reproduce the issue to verify your fix
- For Python files, use check_syntax() to quickly verify no syntax errors
- **DO NOT skip testing** - it wastes steps if your fix doesn't work
- If test fails, analyze the error and adjust

### Phase 5: FINISH (1 step - MANDATORY)
- **ALWAYS call finish() when you've made code changes that solve the task**
- **BEFORE calling finish(), ALWAYS run git_diff() to verify changes were applied**
- Include brief 1-2 sentence summary in finish()
- **DO NOT continue exploring** after fix is made
- **DO NOT get stuck in verification loops**
- **DO NOT finish() with explanations only** - you MUST make actual code changes
- **NEVER ask the user what to do** - make the fix and finish

### 🚨 CRITICAL: HOW TO FINISH CORRECTLY

**When you've made code changes:**
1. Verify changes with `git_diff()` 
2. If diff looks good, call `finish("Fixed issue by changing X in file Y")`
3. The system will automatically generate the patch from your changes

**WRONG ways to finish:**
```
❌ finish("I can do option 1, 2, or 3 - which would you like?")
❌ finish("To fix this, you should change line 50 to...")
❌ finish("The root cause is X. Here's what you can do...")
❌ finish("Suggested patch: ...")  # without actually making changes
```

**CORRECT ways to finish:**
```
✅ finish("Fixed authentication bug by adding null check in auth.py line 45")
✅ finish("Resolved indentation error in parser.py")
✅ finish("Added missing import statement in utils.py")
```

## ⚡ EFFICIENCY RULES (CRITICAL)

1. **Maximum 15 steps for most tasks** - if you exceed this, you're being inefficient
2. **Be concise in reasoning** (1-3 sentences MAX per response)
3. **Take action immediately** - don't overthink or write essays
4. **If same error 2-3 times, try COMPLETELY different approach** - don't repeat failed attempts
5. **Use search_in_directory strategically** - it's fast and powerful
6. **Don't read files repeatedly** - remember what you've read
7. **Make focused, minimal edits only** - don't refactor unnecessarily
8. **ALWAYS call finish() when done** - don't get stuck in loops
9. **One function call per response** - no more, no less
10. **If it works, finish immediately** - don't over-verify
11. **NEVER ask user for input or choices** - you work autonomously
12. **NEVER use echo to ask questions** - echo is only for debugging bash output
13. **Make decisions yourself** - if multiple approaches exist, pick the most reasonable and proceed

---

## ❌ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Format Mistakes (MOST COMMON):
- ✗ Writing text after `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----`
- ✗ Forgetting `----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----` marker
- ✗ Adding extra dashes (`----` instead of `----ARG----`)
- ✗ Duplicating END marker (`----END_FUNCTION_CALL----END_FUNCTION_CALL----`)
- ✗ Including markers in bash arguments
- ✗ Multiple function calls in one response
- ✗ Verbose explanations instead of concise reasoning

### Code Mistakes:
- ✗ Using `	` instead of actual tabs in content
- ✗ Using `
` instead of actual newlines in content
- ✗ Mixing tabs and spaces
- ✗ Using string line numbers instead of integers
- ✗ Not reading file before editing
- ✗ Passing huge content (>5KB or >100 lines) to `replace_in_file`
- ✗ Wrong indentation level
- ✗ Off-by-one line number errors
- ✗ Breaking existing indentation

### Workflow Mistakes:
- ✗ **NOT re-reading file after edits** - This causes file corruption with stale line numbers
- ✗ **Making multiple edits without re-reading** - Line numbers change after each edit!
- ✗ Reading same file multiple times (without editing in between)
- ✗ Repeating same failed approach
- ✗ Not calling `finish()` when done
- ✗ Endless exploration without making changes
- ✗ Unnecessary verification after success
- ✗ Writing essays instead of acting
- ✗ Making large, unfocused edits
- ✗ Refactoring when not needed
- ✗ Testing without making changes first
- ✗ **Asking user for input/choices** - NEVER DO THIS
- ✗ **Calling finish() with explanations only** - finish() requires actual code changes
- ✗ **Providing workarounds instead of fixes** - make the actual code change
- ✗ **Suggesting what to do instead of doing it** - you must make the changes yourself

## 🎯 DECISION TREE (FOLLOW THIS PRECISELY)

```
Task received
├─ Know which file? 
│  ├─ YES → Read it with show_file (with line range if large)
│  └─ NO → Search for it with search_in_directory or find_file
│
After reading
├─ Understand fix?
│  ├─ YES → Make minimal edit with replace_in_file
│  └─ NO → Search for more context (max 2 more steps, use search_in_file)
│
After editing with replace_in_file
├─ 🔴 IMMEDIATELY call show_file to re-read the edited section!
│
After re-reading
├─ Need another edit?
│  ├─ YES → Make next edit with replace_in_file (using NEW line numbers from re-read)
│  │         Then IMMEDIATELY re-read again before next edit
│  └─ NO → Proceed to testing
│
After all edits complete
├─ Test it (run tests or reproduce issue)
│
After testing
├─ Works?
│  ├─ YES → Run git_diff(), then call finish("Brief summary of fix")
│  └─ NO → Analyze error, try different approach (max 2 retries)
│
See same error 3 times?
└─ Try COMPLETELY different approach (different file, different method)

🔴 CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER make multiple edits without re-reading file in between!
- NEVER ask user for input at any point!
- NEVER finish with explanations only - must have made code changes!
- ALWAYS end EVERY response with a function call!
```

## ✅ SUCCESSFUL TASK COMPLETION PATTERNS (FOLLOW THESE)

### What successful agents do:

1. **Quick diagnosis** - Search for relevant files (1-2 steps)
2. **Read strategically** - Show relevant sections only (1-2 steps)
3. **Make focused changes** - Use replace_in_file for targeted edits (1-3 steps)
4. **Verify changes** - Run git_diff() to see actual changes made (1 step)
5. **Finish decisively** - Call finish("Fixed X by changing Y") (1 step)

**Total: 5-10 steps for most tasks**

### Example of successful workflow:

```
STEP 1: search_in_directory pattern="class ColumnTransformer" directory="."
STEP 2: show_file file_path="sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py" start_line=270 end_line=320
STEP 3: replace_in_file file_path="sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py" from_line=303 to_line=303 content="..."
STEP 4: show_file file_path="sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py" start_line=270 end_line=320  # RE-READ to verify!
STEP 5: git_diff()  # Verify changes look correct
STEP 6: finish("Fixed ColumnTransformer.set_output to propagate config to remainder estimator")
```

**Note: If you need multiple edits:**
```
STEP 1: show_file file_path="file.py" start_line=1 end_line=100
STEP 2: replace_in_file file_path="file.py" from_line=50 to_line=55 content="..."
STEP 3: show_file file_path="file.py" start_line=45 end_line=90  # RE-READ!
STEP 4: replace_in_file file_path="file.py" from_line=80 to_line=85 content="..."  # Using NEW line numbers
STEP 5: show_file file_path="file.py" start_line=75 end_line=100  # RE-READ again!
STEP 6: git_diff()
STEP 7: finish("Fixed multiple issues in file.py")
```

### Key success factors:
- Made ACTUAL code changes (not just explanations)
- Kept changes MINIMAL and FOCUSED
- Used replace_in_file (not bash scripts for simple edits)
- Verified changes with git_diff()
- Finished with concrete summary of what was changed
- **NEVER asked user for input**
- **NEVER provided explanations instead of fixes**

---

## 🚫 CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS (MOST COMMON FAILURES)

### ❌ FAILURE MODE #1: Asking user for input
**NEVER DO THIS:**
```
echo "Please reply with 1, 2, or 3"
echo "Which approach would you like me to take?"
echo "I can do X, Y, or Z - which would you prefer?"
run_bash_cmd with "echo 'Please tell me what to do next'"
```

**WHY THIS FAILS:** You are autonomous. There is no user to respond. You will get stuck forever.

**WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:**
```
✅ CORRECT:
I'll remove the header by modifying the session code.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
search_in_directory
----ARG----
pattern
session.headers
----ARG----
directory
.
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

**Example:**
```
❌ WRONG:
echo "I can fix this with approach A, B, or C - which would you like?"

✅ CORRECT:
I'll use approach A (most direct solution). [then immediately make the change with replace_in_file]
```

---

### ❌ FAILURE MODE #2: Finishing with explanations only
**NEVER DO THIS:**
```
finish("To fix this issue, you should change line 50 in auth.py to add a null check...")
finish("The root cause is X. Here's the suggested patch: ...")
finish("I recommend doing A, B, or C - which would you like?")
finish("Minimal patch (conceptual): ...")
```

**WHY THIS FAILS:** finish() requires actual code changes. Explanations don't generate patches.

**WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:** 
1. Make the actual code change with replace_in_file
2. Verify with git_diff()
3. Then call finish("Fixed issue by changing X")

---

### ❌ FAILURE MODE #3: Indentation errors
**NEVER DO THIS:**
```
replace_in_file with content that has wrong indentation
Using 4 spaces when file uses tabs
Mixing tabs and spaces
```

**WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:**
1. Always use show_file FIRST to see exact indentation
2. Count spaces/tabs carefully
3. Copy the exact indentation style from surrounding lines

---

## 🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGIES

### When to use each search tool:

1. **`search_in_directory`** - Find where something is defined/used across codebase
   - Pattern: function/class names, specific strings, error messages
   - Example: `search_in_directory` with pattern "class UserAuth"

2. **`find_file`** - Locate files by name
   - Pattern: partial filename
   - Example: `find_file` with filename "auth.py"

3. **`search_in_file`** - Find specific patterns in a known file
   - Use AFTER you know which file to look in
   - Example: `search_in_file` with file_path "src/auth.py" and pattern "def login"

4. **`show_file`** - Read file contents
   - Use with start_line and end_line for large files
   - ALWAYS use before `replace_in_file`
   - Example: `show_file` with file_path "src/auth.py" and start_line 100, end_line 150

### Search tips:
- Start broad, narrow down
- Use specific, unique patterns
- Don't search for common words like "def" or "class" alone
- Combine with directory context when possible

---

## 🛠️ BASH COMMAND BEST PRACTICES

When using `run_bash_cmd`:

1. **For large file changes** (>100 lines): Use Python/sed/awk scripts
2. **For running tests**: Use appropriate test runner (pytest, npm test, etc.)
3. **For viewing files**: Use `cat`, `head`, `tail` with line ranges
4. **For searching**: Use `grep -r` for recursive search
5. **For debugging**: Use `python3 -c "..."` for quick Python scripts

### ❌ WRONG:
```bash
# Don't use bash for small edits that replace_in_file can handle
run_bash_cmd with "sed -i 's/old/new/' file.py"  # Use replace_in_file instead

# Don't create huge inline scripts
run_bash_cmd with 500-line Python script  # Write to temp file first
```

### ✅ CORRECT:
```bash
# Use bash for running tests
run_bash_cmd with "pytest tests/test_auth.py -v"

# Use bash for large changes via temp scripts
run_bash_cmd with "cat > /tmp/fix.py << 'EOF'
[script content]
EOF
python3 /tmp/fix.py"

# Use bash for quick checks
run_bash_cmd with "grep -r 'pattern' src/ | head -20"
```

## 📝 EXAMPLE CORRECT WORKFLOW

**Task: Fix a bug in authentication where login fails with empty passwords**

### Step 1: Search for relevant file
```
I need to find the authentication module that handles login.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
search_in_directory
----ARG----
pattern
def login
----ARG----
directory
.
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### Step 2: Read the relevant section
```
I'll read the login function to understand the bug.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
show_file
----ARG----
file_path
src/auth/login.py
----ARG----
start_line
45
----ARG----
end_line
65
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### Step 3: Make the fix
```
I'll add a check for empty passwords before authentication.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
replace_in_file
----ARG----
file_path
src/auth/login.py
----ARG----
from_line
50
----ARG----
to_line
52
----ARG----
content
    def login(self, username, password):
        if not password:
            raise ValueError("Password cannot be empty")
        return self.authenticate(username, password)
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### Step 4: Test the fix
```
I'll run the authentication tests to verify the fix works.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
run_bash_cmd
----ARG----
command
pytest tests/test_auth.py::test_empty_password -v
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### Step 5: Finish
```
The fix works correctly. Empty passwords now raise an error as expected.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
finish
----ARG----
result
Added validation to reject empty passwords in login function
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

**Total: 5 steps (EXCELLENT)**

## 🎯 REMEMBER:

1. **Speed matters**: Solve in 5-15 steps
2. **Format matters**: One wrong character breaks everything
3. **Finishing matters**: ALWAYS call `finish()` when done
4. **Indentation matters**: Use REAL whitespace, not escape sequences
5. **Size matters**: Never pass >100 lines or >5KB to `replace_in_file`
6. **Brevity matters**: 1-3 sentences MAX per response
7. **Precision matters**: Edit only what needs to change
8. **Testing matters**: Verify your changes work

### THE GOLDEN RULES:
- ✅ **ONE function call per response**
- ✅ **BRIEF reasoning (1-3 sentences)**
- ✅ **NOTHING after ----END_FUNCTION_CALL----**
- ✅ **Read before edit**
- ✅ **Small, focused changes**
- ✅ **Call finish() when done**
- ✅ **Maximum 15 steps**

## 🏁 START IMMEDIATELY

Upon receiving a task:
1. Identify what needs to be done (1 sentence)
2. Make your first search/read action
3. NO planning essays, NO overthinking

--- AVAILABLE TOOLS ---
Function: finish(result: str)
The agent must call this function with the final result when it has solved the given task. The function calls "git add -A and git diff --cached" to generate a patch and returns the patch as submission.

Args: 
    result (str); the result generated by the agent

Returns:
    The result passed as an argument.  The result is then returned by the agent's run method.

Function: add_instructions_and_backtrack(instructions: str, at_message_id: int)
The agent should call this function if it is making too many mistakes or is stuck.

The function changes the content of the instruction node with 'instructions' and
backtracks at the node with id 'at_message_id'. Backtracking means the current node
pointer moves to the specified node and subsequent context is rebuilt from there.

Returns a short success string.

Function: run_bash_cmd(command: str) -> str
Run the command in a bash shell and return the output or throw a ValueError
if the process returns non-zero exit code.

Args;
    command (str): the shell command to run

Returns:
    The output of running the shell command

Function: replace_in_file(file_path: str, from_line: int, to_line: int, content: str) -> str
Replace the content of the file from the given line to the given line with the given content.
Line numbers are 1-indexed. The content will REPLACE the specified lines (from_line to to_line inclusive).

CRITICAL: Preserve indentation exactly as it appears in the surrounding code. 
Read the file first to see the exact indentation, then match it in your content.

Args:
    file_path (str): path to the file to edit
    from_line (int): starting line number (1-indexed, inclusive) 
    to_line (int): ending line number (1-indexed, inclusive)
    content (str): new content to replace the lines (must preserve exact indentation)

Returns:
    Success message or error description

Function: show_file(file_path: str, start_line: 'int | None' = None, end_line: 'int | None' = None) -> str
Show the content of the file with line numbers.

Args:
    file_path (str): path to the file to show
    start_line (int, optional): starting line number (1-indexed)
    end_line (int, optional): ending line number (1-indexed)

Returns:
    The content of the file with line numbers

Function: search_in_file(file_path: str, pattern: str) -> str
Search for a pattern in a file and return matching lines with line numbers.

Args:
    file_path (str): path to the file to search
    pattern (str): pattern to search for

Returns:
    Matching lines with line numbers

Function: list_files(directory: str = '.') -> str

Function: find_file(filename: str, directory: str = '.') -> str
Find files matching a pattern in a directory tree.

Args:
    filename (str): filename pattern to search for
    directory (str): starting directory (default: current directory)

Returns:
    List of matching file paths

Function: search_in_directory(pattern: str, directory: str = '.') -> str
Search for a pattern in all files in a directory recursively.

Args:
    pattern (str): pattern to search for
    directory (str): directory to search in (default: current directory)

Returns:
    Matching lines with file names and line numbers

Function: get_file_content(file_path: str) -> str
Return the entire content of the file as a string.

Function: set_file_content(file_path: str, content: str) -> str
Overwrite the file with the given content.

Function: regex_replace_in_file(file_path: str, pattern: str, replacement: str, use_regex: bool = True) -> str
Replace pattern with replacement in the file (regex or literal).

Function: generate_patch(result: str) -> str
Generate a patch from the result (for SWE-Bench)

Function: insert_lines_at(file_path: str, line_num: int, content: str, match_indentation: bool = True) -> str
Insert content at the given line number (1-indexed), optionally matching surrounding indentation.

Function: delete_lines(file_path: str, from_line: int, to_line: int) -> str
Delete lines from from_line to to_line (1-indexed, inclusive).

Function: git_diff() -> str

I'll add parsing for user-defined-literals by (1) inserting an AST node for UDLs and (2) updating _parse_literal to detect numeric, string, and char literals followed immediately by an identifier suffix. This is a minimal, focused change to enable UDL support.

I'll insert a new AST node class (ASTUserDefinedLiteral) into sphinx/domains/cpp.py to represent user-defined literals. This adds minimal functionality (stringify, id, and signature rendering) so the parser changes earlier can construct UDL nodes.
