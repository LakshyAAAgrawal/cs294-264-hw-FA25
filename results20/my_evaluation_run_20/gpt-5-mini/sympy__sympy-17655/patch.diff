+    
         When sequences of coordinates are passed to Point methods, they
         are converted to a Point internally. This __add__ method does
         not do that so if floating point values are used, a floating
         point result (in terms of SymPy Floats) will be returned.
-
+    
         >>> Point(1, 2) + (.1, .2)
         Point2D(1.1, 2.2)
-
+    
         If this is not desired, the `translate` method can be used or
         another Point can be added:
-
+    
         >>> Point(1, 2).translate(.1, .2)
         Point2D(11/10, 11/5)
         >>> Point(1, 2) + Point(.1, .2)
         Point2D(11/10, 11/5)
