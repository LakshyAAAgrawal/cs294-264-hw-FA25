I confirmed your reading: older Django releases did not apply SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS when validating the session auth hash, so rotating SECRET_KEY without an appropriate fix could log users out. The bug was reported as ticket #34384 and subsequently fixed. ([code.djangoproject.com](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34384))

What changed and where to look:
- The Django settings docs describe SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS as the mechanism to allow secret key rotation, but your observation about get_session_auth_hash/salted_hmac was correct for older code before the fix. See the current settings docs for the intended behavior. ([docs.djangoproject.com](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/?utm_source=openai))
- The issue was tracked and fixed in Django's repository (fix committed on main and backported to maintenance branches). The fix was included in releases backported to 4.1.x and 4.2.x. ([code.djangoproject.com](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34384))
- There is evidence in the contrib.auth flow that the auth machinery was updated to check fallback keys when verifying session hashes (the ticket and commits implement that change). ([docs.djangoproject.com](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2//_modules/django/contrib/auth/?utm_source=openai))

Practical advice:
1. If everyone got logged out after you rotated SECRET_KEY, you are most likely running a Django version released before the fix (the fix and backports were applied in March–April 2023 and appear in the 4.1.8 release notes dated April 5, 2023). Upgrading to a patched release (e.g., 4.1.8 or later in the 4.1 branch, or a fixed 4.2.x/5.x) will ensure SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS is respected for session auth hashes. ([django.readthedocs.io](https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releases/4.1.8.html?utm_source=openai))

2. If you cannot upgrade immediately, a common workaround is to use a rotation helper that validates sessions with the old key(s) and re-signs them with the new key when users make requests (there are third-party packages and middleware for this purpose, e.g. django-rotate-secret-key). Plan to remove fallback keys only after users have had a chance to refresh their sessions. ([github.com](https://github.com/EralpB/django-rotate-secret-key?utm_source=openai))

3. Longer-term, note the subtlety discussed in the ticket: even when fallback keys validate a session, those sessions’ stored auth hashes were generated under the old secret — the ticket discussion suggests updating the stored session hash (for example, calling update_session_auth_hash() when a fallback key is used) to avoid invalidation once the fallbacks are removed. The ticket authors accepted this as part of the fix discussion. ([code.djangoproject.com](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34384))

Summary:
- Your reading was correct for older Django code: SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS did not affect session auth hashes prior to the fix. ([code.djangoproject.com](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34384))
- The maintainers fixed and backported the change; upgrade to a patched Django (4.1.8+ or the corresponding backported 4.2/5.x release) to avoid the logouts, or use a rotation helper until you can upgrade. ([django.readthedocs.io](https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releases/4.1.8.html?utm_source=openai))

If you want, tell me:
- the exact Django version you’re running (python -m django --version output) and I’ll confirm whether it contains the fix and give an upgrade/workaround plan.
