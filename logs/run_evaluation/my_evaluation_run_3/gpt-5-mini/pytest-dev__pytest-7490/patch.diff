Inserted a re-evaluation of xfail marks into pytest_runtest_makereport so that xfail markers added during test execution (e.g., via request.node.add_marker / request.applymarker) are recognized. Changed file: src/_pytest/skipping.py â€” when item._store[xfailed_key] is None, evaluate_xfail_marks(item) is called and stored before report handling.
