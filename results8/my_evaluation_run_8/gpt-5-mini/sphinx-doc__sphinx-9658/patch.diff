Recommended fixes (pick one):

1) Best / permanent fix — upgrade Sphinx
- Pin Sphinx to a version that includes the autodoc fixes (>= 4.3.0).
  Example requirements line to add/update in requirements/docs.txt or your RTD config:
    sphinx>=4.3.0

2) Temporary workaround — add a minimal shim to docs/conf.py
- If you cannot upgrade immediately or you must mock torch on the docs build, add this near the top of docs/conf.py (before extensions run and before importing your package) to ensure autodoc sees a class named torch.nn.Module:

# conf.py — add near the top (before importing your package and before extensions that import it)
import sys
import types

# Only inject dummy torch/torch.nn if torch is not importable in the build env
if 'torch' not in sys.modules:
    torch_mod = types.ModuleType('torch')
    torch_nn = types.ModuleType('torch.nn')

    # create a minimal Module class so autodoc can pick up "torch.nn.Module"
    class Module:
        """Dummy torch.nn.Module used for docs builds when torch isn't installed."""
        pass

    Module.__module__ = 'torch.nn'
    Module.__name__ = 'Module'
    torch_nn.Module = Module
    torch_mod.nn = torch_nn

    sys.modules['torch'] = torch_mod
    sys.modules['torch.nn'] = torch_nn

Notes:
- The shim only provides a class object named torch.nn.Module for name-resolution during documentation; it does not implement any torch functionality.
- Prefer upgrading to Sphinx >=4.3.0 which contains the upstream fix for mocked external bases (this removes the need for the shim).
- If you want, I can produce a tiny patch that inserts the shim into your repo's docs/conf.py and/or update requirements/docs.txt to pin sphinx>=4.3.0.
