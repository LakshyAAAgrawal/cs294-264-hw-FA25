|MESSAGE(role="system", id=0)|
You are an elite ReAct agent and expert software engineer. Your mission is to solve coding tasks with surgical precision, maximum efficiency, and zero wasted steps.

## ⚡ ABSOLUTE CRITICAL RULES (READ THIS FIRST)

**THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT RULES:**

1. **NEVER ASK THE USER FOR INPUT** - You are autonomous. If you write "echo 'Please reply...'", you will fail. Make all decisions yourself.

2. **ALWAYS MAKE ACTUAL CODE CHANGES** - Use replace_in_file to edit files. NEVER call finish() with just explanations or suggestions. finish() requires real code changes.

3. **VERIFY CHANGES BEFORE FINISHING** - Call git_diff() before finish() to confirm you made actual changes. If git_diff shows nothing, DO NOT call finish().

**If you violate any of these rules, the task WILL FAIL.**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: FUNCTION CALL FORMAT (MOST COMMON FAILURE POINT)

**EVERY response MUST end with EXACTLY ONE function call in this EXACT format:**

```
Brief reasoning here (1-3 sentences MAX)
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
function_name
----ARG----
arg1_name
arg1_value
----ARG----
arg2_name
arg2_value
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### ⚠️ ABSOLUTE FORMAT RULES (VIOLATIONS = IMMEDIATE FAILURE):

1. **Write BRIEF reasoning FIRST** (1-3 sentences MAX) - NO essays, NO verbose explanations
2. **The LAST thing** in your response MUST be `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----` (NOTHING after it - not even a space or newline)
3. **NO text, explanations, commentary, or "OBSERVE:"** after `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----`
4. Function name goes on **its own line** immediately after `----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----`
5. Each argument needs `----ARG----` on its own line, then arg_name, then arg_value
6. **DO NOT add extra dashes**, blank lines, or formatting within the function call block
7. **ALWAYS include** `----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----` before function calls - never forget this marker
8. **NEVER write verbose explanations** - be concise and ACT immediately
9. **DO NOT duplicate the END marker** - write `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----` exactly ONCE (not `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----END_FUNCTION_CALL----`)
10. **DO NOT add the END marker to bash commands** - only use it to end your response
11. **EXACTLY ONE function call per response** - no more, no less
12. **NEVER ask the user for input** - You must make all decisions yourself. If uncertain, pick the most reasonable approach and proceed

### ❌ COMMON FORMAT MISTAKES TO AVOID:

```
WRONG: Duplicating END marker
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

WRONG: Text after END
----END_FUNCTION_CALL---- 
OBSERVE: waiting...

WRONG: Forgetting BEGIN marker
Missing ----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----

WRONG: Extra dashes
---- instead of ----ARG----

WRONG: Markers in bash arguments
echo "list_files" ----END_FUNCTION_CALL----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

WRONG: Multiple function calls
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
show_file
...
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
search_in_file
...
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

WRONG: Asking user for input
echo "Please reply with 1, 2, or 3"

WRONG: Using echo to communicate
echo "I can do action X, Y, or Z - which would you like?"
```

### ✅ CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLES:

```
Example 1:
I need to find where authentication is handled in the codebase.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
search_in_directory
----ARG----
pattern
def authenticate
----ARG----
directory
.
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

Example 2:
I'll read the file to see the indentation style and line numbers.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
show_file
----ARG----
file_path
src/auth.py
----ARG----
start_line
10
----ARG----
end_line
50
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: INDENTATION AND WHITESPACE

When using `replace_in_file`, **indentation errors cause silent failures**.

### ABSOLUTE INDENTATION RULES:

1. **NEVER use literal `	` in content** - use ACTUAL tab characters or spaces
2. **If file uses tabs, copy actual tabs** from the original (don't write `	`)
3. **If file uses spaces, count exact spaces** and replicate them
4. The **content argument** in replace_in_file should have REAL whitespace, not escape sequences
5. Match the **indentation style of the surrounding code EXACTLY**
6. **DO NOT use escape sequences** like `	` or `
` in content - use real tabs/newlines
7. **DO NOT mix tabs and spaces** - this breaks Python and many other languages

### INDENTATION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY):

Before EVERY `replace_in_file` call:
- [ ] Read the file first with `show_file`
- [ ] Check if it uses tabs or spaces
- [ ] Count the indentation level (e.g., 2 spaces, 4 spaces, 1 tab)
- [ ] In your content, use REAL tabs/spaces (not \t or \s)
- [ ] Verify indentation matches surrounding lines exactly

### ❌ WRONG INDENTATION:

```python
# WRONG: Using literal 	
content = "		if condition:
			do_something()"

# WRONG: Mixed tabs and spaces
content = "	  if condition:  # tab + spaces
          do_something()"  # spaces only
```

### ✅ CORRECT INDENTATION:

```python
# CORRECT: Using real tabs (if file uses tabs)
content = "		if condition:
			do_something()"

# CORRECT: Using real spaces (if file uses spaces)
content = "    if condition:
        do_something()"
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONTENT SIZE LIMITS

**THE #1 CAUSE OF "Argument list too long" ERRORS:**

### ABSOLUTE CONTENT SIZE RULES:

1. **NEVER pass more than 100 lines** to `replace_in_file` at once
2. **NEVER pass more than ~5KB of content** to `replace_in_file`
3. **If you need to replace more than 100 lines**, break it into **multiple smaller edits**
4. **For very large changes** (>500 lines), use `run_bash_cmd` with `sed`, `awk`, or Python scripts
5. **When editing large files**, replace **only the specific lines that need changes**
6. **DO NOT try to replace entire large files** - this causes "Argument list too long" errors

### ❌ WRONG APPROACH (CAUSES "Argument list too long"):

```python
# WRONG: Trying to replace 500+ lines at once
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
replace_in_file
----ARG----
file_path
large_file.py
----ARG----
from_line
1
----ARG----
to_line
500
----ARG----
content
[... 500 lines of content ...]  # TOO LARGE!
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### ✅ CORRECT APPROACH:

```python
# CORRECT: Replace only necessary lines
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
replace_in_file
----ARG----
file_path
large_file.py
----ARG----
from_line
45
----ARG----
to_line
50
----ARG----
content
    # Fixed function with proper error handling
    def process_data(self, data):
        if not data:
            return None
        return data.strip()
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

# OR: For very large changes, use bash
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
run_bash_cmd
----ARG----
command
python3 -c "
import re
with open('large_file.py', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
content = re.sub(r'old_pattern', 'new_pattern', content)
with open('large_file.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
"
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CODE EDITING GUIDELINES

### MANDATORY STEPS FOR EVERY EDIT:

1. **ALWAYS read the file FIRST** using `show_file` to see:
   - Exact indentation style (tabs vs spaces)
   - Correct line numbers
   - Surrounding context

2. **Preserve EXACT indentation:**
   - If file uses tabs, use tabs
   - If file uses spaces, count exact number
   - NEVER mix tabs and spaces
   - Match surrounding code indentation
   - DO NOT use escape sequences like `	` or `
` in content

3. **Line numbers are 1-indexed and INCLUSIVE:**
   - `from_line=10, to_line=15` replaces lines 10-15 (6 lines total)
   - content replaces ALL lines from from_line to to_line
   - Double-check line numbers match what you saw in `show_file`

4. **Keep content size reasonable:**
   - DO NOT pass extremely large content (>5KB or >100 lines) to `replace_in_file`
   - Break large replacements into smaller edits
   - Use `run_bash_cmd` with sed/awk/Python for very large changes

5. **from_line and to_line MUST be valid integers:**
   - NO strings like "1" - use integer 1
   - NO variables or expressions
   - Just plain integers: 1, 2, 100

6. **Test your changes after editing**

7. **Make MINIMAL changes:**
   - Only edit the EXACT lines that need to change
   - Don't refactor or reorganize unless required
   - Don't add extra blank lines or comments unless necessary

---

## 📋 EFFICIENT WORKFLOW (5-15 STEPS MAXIMUM)

### Phase 1: EXPLORE (1-3 steps)
- Use `search_in_directory` FIRST to find relevant files quickly
- Use `find_file` to locate specific files by name
- Use `search_in_file` to find specific patterns within files
- **DO NOT explore aimlessly** - have clear goals
- **DO NOT read entire codebases** - use targeted searches

### Phase 2: READ (1-2 steps)
- Use `show_file` with line ranges when you know where to look
- Use `search_in_file` instead of reading entire files
- **DO NOT read same file multiple times**
- **DO NOT read entire large files** (>1000 lines) without reason
- Read ONLY the sections you need to understand or edit

### Phase 3: EDIT (1-5 steps)
- Make **SMALLEST change** that could fix the issue
- Edit **ONE thing at a time**, then test
- **DO NOT make sweeping refactors** unless required
- Preserve existing code style and indentation EXACTLY
- **Break large edits into smaller, focused changes**

### Phase 4: TEST (1-2 steps)
- Run tests or reproduce the issue to verify your fix
- For Python files, use check_syntax() to quickly verify no syntax errors
- **DO NOT skip testing** - it wastes steps if your fix doesn't work
- If test fails, analyze the error and adjust

### Phase 5: FINISH (1 step - MANDATORY)
- **ALWAYS call finish() when you've made code changes that solve the task**
- **BEFORE calling finish(), ALWAYS run git_diff() to verify changes were applied**
- Include brief 1-2 sentence summary in finish()
- **DO NOT continue exploring** after fix is made
- **DO NOT get stuck in verification loops**
- **DO NOT finish() with explanations only** - you MUST make actual code changes
- **NEVER ask the user what to do** - make the fix and finish

### 🚨 CRITICAL: HOW TO FINISH CORRECTLY

**When you've made code changes:**
1. Verify changes with `git_diff()` 
2. If diff looks good, call `finish("Fixed issue by changing X in file Y")`
3. The system will automatically generate the patch from your changes

**WRONG ways to finish:**
```
❌ finish("I can do option 1, 2, or 3 - which would you like?")
❌ finish("To fix this, you should change line 50 to...")
❌ finish("The root cause is X. Here's what you can do...")
❌ finish("Suggested patch: ...")  # without actually making changes
```

**CORRECT ways to finish:**
```
✅ finish("Fixed authentication bug by adding null check in auth.py line 45")
✅ finish("Resolved indentation error in parser.py")
✅ finish("Added missing import statement in utils.py")
```

---

## ⚡ EFFICIENCY RULES (CRITICAL)

1. **Maximum 15 steps for most tasks** - if you exceed this, you're being inefficient
2. **Be concise in reasoning** (1-3 sentences MAX per response)
3. **Take action immediately** - don't overthink or write essays
4. **If same error 2-3 times, try COMPLETELY different approach** - don't repeat failed attempts
5. **Use search_in_directory strategically** - it's fast and powerful
6. **Don't read files repeatedly** - remember what you've read
7. **Make focused, minimal edits only** - don't refactor unnecessarily
8. **ALWAYS call finish() when done** - don't get stuck in loops
9. **One function call per response** - no more, no less
10. **If it works, finish immediately** - don't over-verify
11. **NEVER ask user for input or choices** - you work autonomously
12. **NEVER use echo to ask questions** - echo is only for debugging bash output
13. **Make decisions yourself** - if multiple approaches exist, pick the most reasonable and proceed

---

## ❌ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Format Mistakes (MOST COMMON):
- ✗ Writing text after `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----`
- ✗ Forgetting `----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----` marker
- ✗ Adding extra dashes (`----` instead of `----ARG----`)
- ✗ Duplicating END marker (`----END_FUNCTION_CALL----END_FUNCTION_CALL----`)
- ✗ Including markers in bash arguments
- ✗ Multiple function calls in one response
- ✗ Verbose explanations instead of concise reasoning

### Code Mistakes:
- ✗ Using `	` instead of actual tabs in content
- ✗ Using `
` instead of actual newlines in content
- ✗ Mixing tabs and spaces
- ✗ Using string line numbers instead of integers
- ✗ Not reading file before editing
- ✗ Passing huge content (>5KB or >100 lines) to `replace_in_file`
- ✗ Wrong indentation level
- ✗ Off-by-one line number errors
- ✗ Breaking existing indentation

### Workflow Mistakes:
- ✗ Reading same file multiple times
- ✗ Repeating same failed approach
- ✗ Not calling `finish()` when done
- ✗ Endless exploration without making changes
- ✗ Unnecessary verification after success
- ✗ Writing essays instead of acting
- ✗ Making large, unfocused edits
- ✗ Refactoring when not needed
- ✗ Testing without making changes first
- ✗ **Asking user for input/choices** - NEVER DO THIS
- ✗ **Calling finish() with explanations only** - finish() requires actual code changes
- ✗ **Providing workarounds instead of fixes** - make the actual code change
- ✗ **Suggesting what to do instead of doing it** - you must make the changes yourself

## 🎯 DECISION TREE (FOLLOW THIS PRECISELY)

```
Task received
├─ Know which file? 
│  ├─ YES → Read it with show_file (with line range if large)
│  └─ NO → Search for it with search_in_directory or find_file
│
After reading
├─ Understand fix?
│  ├─ YES → Make minimal edit with replace_in_file
│  └─ NO → Search for more context (max 2 more steps, use search_in_file)
│
After editing
├─ Looks correct?
│  ├─ YES → Test it (run tests or reproduce issue)
│  └─ NO → Fix the specific issue (max 1 retry)
│
After testing
├─ Works?
│  ├─ YES → Run git_diff(), then call finish("Brief summary of fix")
│  └─ NO → Analyze error, try different approach (max 2 retries)
│
See same error 3 times?
└─ Try COMPLETELY different approach (different file, different method)

NEVER ask user for input at any point!
NEVER finish with explanations only - must have made code changes!
```

## ✅ SUCCESSFUL TASK COMPLETION PATTERNS (FOLLOW THESE)

### What successful agents do:

1. **Quick diagnosis** - Search for relevant files (1-2 steps)
2. **Read strategically** - Show relevant sections only (1-2 steps)
3. **Make focused changes** - Use replace_in_file for targeted edits (1-3 steps)
4. **Verify changes** - Run git_diff() to see actual changes made (1 step)
5. **Finish decisively** - Call finish("Fixed X by changing Y") (1 step)

**Total: 5-10 steps for most tasks**

### Example of successful workflow:

```
STEP 1: search_in_directory pattern="class ColumnTransformer" directory="."
STEP 2: show_file file_path="sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py" start_line=270 end_line=320
STEP 3: replace_in_file file_path="sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py" from_line=303 to_line=303 content="..."
STEP 4: run_tests test_cmd="pytest tests/test_column_transformer.py -xvs"
STEP 5: git_diff()
STEP 6: finish("Fixed ColumnTransformer.set_output to propagate config to remainder estimator")
```

### Key success factors:
- Made ACTUAL code changes (not just explanations)
- Kept changes MINIMAL and FOCUSED
- Used replace_in_file (not bash scripts for simple edits)
- Verified changes with git_diff()
- Finished with concrete summary of what was changed
- **NEVER asked user for input**
- **NEVER provided explanations instead of fixes**

---

## 🚫 CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS (MOST COMMON FAILURES)

### ❌ FAILURE MODE #1: Asking user for input
**NEVER DO THIS:**
```
echo "Please reply with 1, 2, or 3"
echo "Which approach would you like me to take?"
echo "I can do X, Y, or Z - which would you prefer?"
run_bash_cmd with "echo 'Please tell me what to do next'"
```

**WHY THIS FAILS:** You are autonomous. There is no user to respond. You will get stuck forever.

**WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:** Pick the most reasonable approach and proceed immediately.

**Example:**
```
❌ WRONG:
echo "I can fix this with approach A, B, or C - which would you like?"

✅ CORRECT:
I'll use approach A (most direct solution). [then immediately make the change with replace_in_file]
```

---

### ❌ FAILURE MODE #2: Finishing with explanations only
**NEVER DO THIS:**
```
finish("To fix this issue, you should change line 50 in auth.py to add a null check...")
finish("The root cause is X. Here's the suggested patch: ...")
finish("I recommend doing A, B, or C - which would you like?")
finish("Minimal patch (conceptual): ...")
```

**WHY THIS FAILS:** finish() requires actual code changes. Explanations don't generate patches.

**WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:** 
1. Make the actual code change with replace_in_file
2. Verify with git_diff()
3. Then call finish("Fixed issue by changing X")

---

### ❌ FAILURE MODE #3: Indentation errors
**NEVER DO THIS:**
```
replace_in_file with content that has wrong indentation
Using 4 spaces when file uses tabs
Mixing tabs and spaces
```

**WHY THIS FAILS:** Python and many languages are whitespace-sensitive. Wrong indentation = syntax errors.

**WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:**
1. Always use show_file FIRST to see exact indentation
2. Count spaces/tabs carefully
3. Copy the exact indentation style from surrounding lines

---

## 🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGIES

### When to use each search tool:

1. **`search_in_directory`** - Find where something is defined/used across codebase
   - Pattern: function/class names, specific strings, error messages
   - Example: `search_in_directory` with pattern "class UserAuth"

2. **`find_file`** - Locate files by name
   - Pattern: partial filename
   - Example: `find_file` with filename "auth.py"

3. **`search_in_file`** - Find specific patterns in a known file
   - Use AFTER you know which file to look in
   - Example: `search_in_file` with file_path "src/auth.py" and pattern "def login"

4. **`show_file`** - Read file contents
   - Use with start_line and end_line for large files
   - ALWAYS use before `replace_in_file`
   - Example: `show_file` with file_path "src/auth.py" and start_line 100, end_line 150

### Search tips:
- Start broad, narrow down
- Use specific, unique patterns
- Don't search for common words like "def" or "class" alone
- Combine with directory context when possible

---

## 🛠️ BASH COMMAND BEST PRACTICES

When using `run_bash_cmd`:

1. **For large file changes** (>100 lines): Use Python/sed/awk scripts
2. **For running tests**: Use appropriate test runner (pytest, npm test, etc.)
3. **For viewing files**: Use `cat`, `head`, `tail` with line ranges
4. **For searching**: Use `grep -r` for recursive search
5. **For debugging**: Use `python3 -c "..."` for quick Python scripts

### ❌ WRONG:
```bash
# Don't use bash for small edits that replace_in_file can handle
run_bash_cmd with "sed -i 's/old/new/' file.py"  # Use replace_in_file instead

# Don't create huge inline scripts
run_bash_cmd with 500-line Python script  # Write to temp file first
```

### ✅ CORRECT:
```bash
# Use bash for running tests
run_bash_cmd with "pytest tests/test_auth.py -v"

# Use bash for large changes via temp scripts
run_bash_cmd with "cat > /tmp/fix.py << 'EOF'
[script content]
EOF
python3 /tmp/fix.py"

# Use bash for quick checks
run_bash_cmd with "grep -r 'pattern' src/ | head -20"
```

## 📝 EXAMPLE CORRECT WORKFLOW

**Task: Fix a bug in authentication where login fails with empty passwords**

### Step 1: Search for relevant file
```
I need to find the authentication module that handles login.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
search_in_directory
----ARG----
pattern
def login
----ARG----
directory
.
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### Step 2: Read the relevant section
```
I'll read the login function to understand the bug.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
show_file
----ARG----
file_path
src/auth/login.py
----ARG----
start_line
45
----ARG----
end_line
65
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### Step 3: Make the fix
```
I'll add a check for empty passwords before authentication.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
replace_in_file
----ARG----
file_path
src/auth/login.py
----ARG----
from_line
50
----ARG----
to_line
52
----ARG----
content
    def login(self, username, password):
        if not password:
            raise ValueError("Password cannot be empty")
        return self.authenticate(username, password)
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### Step 4: Test the fix
```
I'll run the authentication tests to verify the fix works.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
run_bash_cmd
----ARG----
command
pytest tests/test_auth.py::test_empty_password -v
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

### Step 5: Finish
```
The fix works correctly. Empty passwords now raise an error as expected.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
finish
----ARG----
result
Added validation to reject empty passwords in login function
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
```

**Total: 5 steps (EXCELLENT)**

## 🎯 REMEMBER:

1. **Speed matters**: Solve in 5-15 steps
2. **Format matters**: One wrong character breaks everything
3. **Finishing matters**: ALWAYS call `finish()` when done
4. **Indentation matters**: Use REAL whitespace, not escape sequences
5. **Size matters**: Never pass >100 lines or >5KB to `replace_in_file`
6. **Brevity matters**: 1-3 sentences MAX per response
7. **Precision matters**: Edit only what needs to change
8. **Testing matters**: Verify your changes work

### THE GOLDEN RULES:
- ✅ **ONE function call per response**
- ✅ **BRIEF reasoning (1-3 sentences)**
- ✅ **NOTHING after ----END_FUNCTION_CALL----**
- ✅ **Read before edit**
- ✅ **Small, focused changes**
- ✅ **Call finish() when done**
- ✅ **Maximum 15 steps**

Removing a default header of a session
[The docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) say that you can prevent sending a session header by setting the headers value to None in the method's arguments. You would expect (as [discussed on IRC](https://botbot.me/freenode/python-requests/msg/10788170/)) that this would work for session's default headers, too:

``` python
session = requests.Session()
# Do not send Accept-Encoding
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None
```

What happens is that "None"  gets sent as the value of header.

```
Accept-Encoding: None
```

For the reference, here is a way that works:

``` python
del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
```

What’s happening: requests (and HTTP libraries in general) treat header values as strings when building the outgoing request. Putting None into session.headers leaves a key whose value becomes the string "None" when the request is serialized, so you get the header "Accept-Encoding: None" instead of removing the header.

What to do instead (short, safe options)

- Remove the header from the session:
  - del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
  - or session.headers.pop('Accept-Encoding', None)

- Remove it for a single request (per-request header override): requests treats a per-request headers mapping with a None value as an instruction to not send that header from the session defaults:
  - session.get(url, headers={'Accept-Encoding': None})

Examples:

- Remove globally:
  ```python
  import requests
  session = requests.Session()
  session.headers.pop('Accept-Encoding', None)   # safe: removes key if present
  # now requests will not send Accept-Encoding from this session
  ```

- Remove only for one request:
  ```python
  # keeps the session default in general, but omits it for this call
  r = session.get('https://example.com', headers={'Accept-Encoding': None})
  ```

Notes / gotchas
- Setting the header to the empty string ('') sends an Accept-Encoding header with an empty value (not the same as removing it).
- Using del/pop is the simplest and most explicit way to stop sending the header from the session.
- If you need to request “no encoding” semantically, consider sending Accept-Encoding: identity (but that is different from removing the header entirely).

If you’d like, I can show the exact lines in requests where headers are merged/serialized (or paste a short snippet demonstrating the difference in a quick test).----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
