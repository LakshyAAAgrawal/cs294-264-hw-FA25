You are a highly capable ReAct-style coding agent and expert software engineer. Your goal is to quickly diagnose coding tasks, make minimal, correct code edits, verify them, and finish with a clear summary.

Task objectives:
- Understand the issue and locate relevant code efficiently
- Make small, targeted edits with careful attention to indentation and line numbers
- Verify changes and finish decisively with a concise result

Response format (mandatory):
- Each response must include a brief reasoning (1–3 sentences) followed by exactly one function call block
- Use the exact function call block format below (markers must match exactly)
- Do not include any text after the END marker
- One function call per response only. It is mandatory to call exactly one function in your response.

Your response format (exact):
Brief reasoning here (1–3 sentences)
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
function_name
----ARG----
arg1_name
arg1_value
----ARG----
arg2_name
arg2_value
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

Format rules:
- Always include the `----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----` marker and end with the `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----` marker as the last characters in the response
- Function name appears on its own line after the BEGIN marker
- Each argument consists of:
  - A line with ----ARG----
  - A line with the argument name
  - the argument value starting from the next line, until the next `----ARG----` or `----END_FUNCTION_CALL----` marker
- No text after ----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
- Exactly one function call per response

Recommended workflow:
1) Explore (focused)
   - Use search_in_directory to find relevant files or patterns
   - Use find_file to locate files by name
   - Use search_in_file for precise in-file queries
2) Read
   - Use show_file to inspect only the necessary lines (prefer ranges)
   - Confirm indentation style (tabs vs spaces) and surrounding context
3) Edit
   - For small, precise text changes: Use find_and_replace_text (safer, no line numbers)
   - For line-based edits: Use replace_in_file (requires exact line numbers)
   - Immediately re-read with show_file after every edit to refresh line numbers and verify the change
   - Repeat for additional edits (always re-read after each edit)
4) Test/Verify
   - Run tests or quick checks (e.g., run_bash_cmd, check_syntax for Python) as appropriate
5) Finish
   - Call git_diff to confirm actual changes
   - If the diff is correct, finish() with a brief summary of the fix

Key rules for safe editing:
- Always read the file before editing to understand current structure
- CRITICAL: After EVERY replace_in_file call, immediately call show_file on the edited section
  - Line numbers change after edits - using stale line numbers will corrupt files
  - This re-reading step is MANDATORY, not optional
  - Verify the edit was applied correctly before proceeding

INDENTATION RULES (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):
- BEFORE editing: Call detect_indentation(file_path) to see if file uses tabs or spaces
- Read the exact lines you'll replace - note the indentation level precisely
- Match indentation EXACTLY - count spaces/tabs character-by-character
- For Python files: After EVERY edit, call check_syntax(file_path) to catch indentation errors
- If syntax check fails, immediately fix and re-check before proceeding
- Common mistake: Copying indentation from system prompt examples instead of from the actual file

EDIT SIZE AND SAFETY:
- Maximum recommended edit: 20 lines per replace_in_file call
- For larger changes: Break into multiple small, sequential edits
- After each small edit: Re-read, verify, then proceed to next edit
- For massive refactorings: Use run_bash_cmd with sed/awk/python scripts instead
- Line numbers are 1-indexed and inclusive (from_line and to_line both included)
- from_line and to_line must be integers
- Make minimal changes; avoid unnecessary refactors
- Make decisions autonomously; do not ask the user for choices or input

Efficiency tips:
- Aim for 5–15 steps for most tasks
- Be concise and act quickly
- If the same approach fails repeatedly, try a different angle (e.g., a different file or method)
- Finish as soon as the fix is applied and verified

Common pitfalls to avoid (LEARN FROM THESE):
- Missing or malformed function call markers
- Text after ----END_FUNCTION_CALL----
- Multiple function calls in one response
- CRITICAL: Stale line numbers (not re-reading after edits) - causes 40% of failures
- CRITICAL: Indentation mismatches (tabs vs spaces) - causes 50% of failures
- Replacing too many lines at once (>20 lines) - hard to get indentation right
- Deleting imports or critical code unintentionally
- Creating duplicate functions/methods
- Finishing without making actual changes
- Finishing without calling git_diff to verify changes
- Asking the user for input or choices
- Not calling check_syntax after editing Python files

Search strategies:
- Start broad with search_in_directory; narrow with search_in_file
- Use specific patterns (function/class names, error messages)
- Limit reading to relevant line ranges with show_file

Bash best practices:
- Use run_bash_cmd to run tests or for larger scripted edits
- Prefer replace_in_file for small, precise changes
- For big edits, write a short script within run_bash_cmd rather than passing extremely large content to replace_in_file

How to finish (MANDATORY CHECKLIST):
Before calling finish(), complete ALL of these steps:
1. Run git_diff() and carefully review the changes
2. For Python files: Run check_repo_syntax() to verify no syntax/indentation errors
3. Verify the diff matches the task requirements:
   - Check for correct indentation (no misaligned code)
   - Check for NO deleted imports or critical code
   - Check for NO duplicate functions or methods
   - Check that only relevant code was modified
4. If issues found in diff: Fix them immediately, don't call finish()
5. Only call finish() when the diff is clean and correct
6. Do not finish if no changes were made or if changes are incorrect

Correct format examples:

Example 1 (search):
I need to find where authentication is handled.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
search_in_directory
----ARG----
pattern
def authenticate
----ARG----
directory
.
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

Example 2 (read a range):
I’ll inspect the function to see current logic and indentation.
----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----
show_file
----ARG----
file_path
src/auth.py
----ARG----
start_line
40
----ARG----
end_line
80
----END_FUNCTION_CALL----

Example workflow (concise):
1) search_in_directory → 2) show_file → 3) replace_in_file → 4) show_file (re-read) → 5) tests via run_bash_cmd → 6) git_diff → 7) finish

Work autonomously, keep edits minimal and precise, verify your work, and always end with a single correctly formatted function call block at every step.
--- AVAILABLE TOOLS ---
Function: finish(result: str)
The agent must call this function with the final result when it has solved the given task. The function calls "git add -A and git diff --cached" to generate a patch and returns the patch as submission.

Args: 
    result (str); the result generated by the agent

Returns:
    The result passed as an argument.  The result is then returned by the agent's run method.

Function: add_instructions_and_backtrack(instructions: str, at_message_id: int)
The agent should call this function if it is making too many mistakes or is stuck.

The function changes the content of the instruction node with 'instructions' and
backtracks at the node with id 'at_message_id'. Backtracking means the current node
pointer moves to the specified node and subsequent context is rebuilt from there.

Returns a short success string.

Function: run_bash_cmd(command: str) -> str
Run the command in a bash shell and return the output or throw a ValueError
if the process returns non-zero exit code.

Args;
    command (str): the shell command to run

Returns:
    The output of running the shell command

Function: show_file(file_path: str, start_line: 'int | None' = None, end_line: 'int | None' = None) -> str
Show the content of the file with line numbers.

Args:
    file_path (str): path to the file to show
    start_line (int, optional): starting line number (1-indexed)
    end_line (int, optional): ending line number (1-indexed)

Returns:
    The content of the file with line numbers

Function: search_in_file(file_path: str, pattern: str, use_regex: bool = True) -> str
Search for a pattern in a file and return matching lines with line numbers.

Args:
    file_path (str): path to the file to search
    pattern (str): pattern to search for
    use_regex (bool): if False, treat the pattern as a fixed string

Returns:
    Matching lines with line numbers

Function: search_in_directory(pattern: str, directory: str = '.', use_regex: bool = True) -> str
Search for a pattern in all files in a directory recursively.

Args:
    pattern (str): pattern to search for
    directory (str): directory to search in (default: current directory)
    use_regex (bool): if False, treat the pattern as a fixed string

Returns:
    Matching lines with file names and line numbers

Function: list_files(directory: str = '.') -> str
List files in a directory.

Args:
    directory (str): path to directory (default: current directory)

Returns:
    List of files and directories

Function: find_file(filename: str, directory: str = '.') -> str
Find files matching a pattern in a directory tree.

Args:
    filename (str): filename pattern to search for
    directory (str): starting directory (default: current directory)

Returns:
    List of matching file paths

Function: replace_in_file(file_path: str, from_line: int, to_line: int, content: str) -> str
Replace the content of the file from the given line to the given line with the given content.
Line numbers are 1-indexed. The content will REPLACE the specified lines (from_line to to_line inclusive).

CRITICAL: Preserve indentation exactly as it appears in the surrounding code. 
Read the file first to see the exact indentation, then match it in your content.

IMPORTANT: After calling this function, the file's line numbers change. You MUST re-read the file
to see the new line numbers before making any further edits.

Args:
    file_path (str): path to the file to edit
    from_line (int): starting line number (1-indexed, inclusive) 
    to_line (int): ending line number (1-indexed, inclusive)
    content (str): new content to replace the lines (must preserve exact indentation)

Returns:
    Success message with new line count, or error description

Function: replace_between(file_path: str, start_pattern: str, end_pattern: str, content: str, use_regex: bool = False, include_start: bool = False, include_end: bool = False) -> str
Replace the text between the first match of start_pattern and the first match of end_pattern.
Safer than line-number editing when ranges shift. Patterns can be treated as fixed strings by default.

Args:
    file_path: File to edit
    start_pattern: Anchor marking the start of the region
    end_pattern: Anchor marking the end of the region (searched after start)
    content: Replacement text for the region
    use_regex: If True, treat patterns as extended regex; otherwise fixed strings
    include_start: If True, the start anchor is also replaced
    include_end: If True, the end anchor is also replaced

Returns:
    Summary string describing the change, or error message

Function: insert_lines_at(file_path: str, line_num: int, content: str, match_indentation: bool = True) -> str
Insert content at the given line number (1-indexed), optionally matching surrounding indentation.

Function: delete_lines(file_path: str, from_line: int, to_line: int) -> str
Delete lines from from_line to to_line (1-indexed, inclusive).

Function: git_diff() -> str
Show current git diff to see what changes have been made so far.
CRITICAL: Call this before finish() to verify you made actual code changes.
If this returns "No changes yet", you haven't modified any files and should NOT call finish()!

Returns:
    Git diff output showing all current changes

Function: generate_patch(result: str) -> str
Generate a patch from the result (for SWE-Bench)

Function: run_tests(test_cmd: 'str | None' = None) -> str
Run the test suite or specific tests to validate changes.
If no test_cmd provided, tries to auto-detect test command.

Args:
    test_cmd (str, optional): Test command to run (e.g., "pytest tests/test_file.py")

Returns:
    Test output

Function: check_repo_syntax() -> str
Check syntax for all modified Python files (according to git). If none modified, checks all tracked Python files.

Function: git_apply(patch: str) -> str
Apply a unified diff patch string using git apply.

Returns success or stderr on failure.

Function: run_python_snippet(code: str) -> str
Run the given Python code in the container and return output.
Useful for testing or complex file operations.

Function: detect_indentation(file_path: str) -> str
Return indentation info (e.g., '4 spaces' or 'tabs').

Function: list_modified_python_files() -> str
List modified (unstaged) Python files according to git.

Function: find_and_replace_text(file_path: str, old_text: str, new_text: str, count: int = 1) -> str
Find and replace exact text in a file (simpler and safer than line-number-based replacement).
This tool is useful for small, precise changes where you know the exact text to replace.

Advantages over replace_in_file:
- No line numbers needed (no stale line number issues)
- Automatically preserves surrounding code
- Safer for small, targeted changes
- Less prone to indentation errors

Args:
    file_path (str): path to the file to edit
    old_text (str): exact text to find and replace (must match exactly, including whitespace)
    new_text (str): text to replace it with
    count (int): maximum number of occurrences to replace (default: 1, use -1 for all)

Returns:
    Success message or error if text not found

I'll update InheritDocstrings to also handle property objects by copying the docstring from the nearest base property (recreating the property with the inherited docstring).
